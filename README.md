# Library-Management-System
A Python &amp; MySQL solution for managing books, members, and checkouts in an library. Features role-based access (Admin/Librarian/Member), inventory control, and circulation tracking. Ideal for small libraries seeking organized digital management. Clean CLI (CommandLine Interface) interface with tabulated data display.
This robust Library Management System represents a complete digital transformation solution for modern libraries, leveraging Python's programming efficiency and MySQL's database reliability.

## **Core System Features**

### **1. User Management Module**
- **Role-Based Access Hierarchy**:
  - *Administrators*: Full system control including user management and database configuration
  - *Librarians*: Daily operational access for circulation and inventory tasks
  - *Members*: Self-service portal for personal accounts and book searches

- **Security Framework**:
  - Individual password-protected accounts
  - Session-based authentication
  - Privilege escalation prevention

### **2. Inventory Management**
- **Complete Bibliographic Control**:
  - ISBN validation and duplicate prevention
  - Multi-field search capabilities (title/author/ISBN)
  - Dynamic quantity adjustment with threshold alerts

- **Collection Analytics**:
  - Usage statistics by title/category
  - Circulation frequency reports
  - Inventory aging analysis

### **3. Circulation System**
- **Transaction Processing**:
  - One-click check-in/check-out
  - Automatic due date calculation
  - Real-time availability indicators

- **Member Services**:
  - Borrowing history tracking
  - Account activity monitoring
  - Personalized recommendation engine

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend Components**
- **Application Layer**: Python 3.10+ using procedural and object-oriented paradigms
- **Database Layer**: MySQL 8.0 with InnoDB engine for ACID compliance
- **Interface Layer**: CLI with tabulated data presentation

### **Data Model**
```plaintext
Books (book_id, ISBN, title, author, quantity)
Members (mem_id, name, join_date, contact, password)
Transactions (transaction_id, book_id, mem_id, issue_date, return_date)
```

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- Processes 50+ simultaneous transactions
- Handles catalogs exceeding 10,000 titles
- Sub-second response time for most queries

## **Implementation Guide**

### **System Requirements**
- **Hardware**:
  - 2GHz dual-core processor minimum
  - 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large collections)
  - 500MB storage space

- **Software**:
  - MySQL Server 8.0+
  - Python 3.10+
  - Supported on Windows/Linux/macOS

### **Installation Process**
1. **Database Setup**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE library_management;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON library_management.* TO 'libadmin'@'localhost';
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv libenv
   source libenv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   libenv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Dependency Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python==8.1.0 tabulate==0.9.0
   ```

4. **System Initialization**:
   ```bash
   python library_management.py
   ```
